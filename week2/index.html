        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          During the reading, I started to remember a lot of things, it was a
          really good reading, chapter 3 was one of the best chapters for me
          this week, to remember more about how arrays work was really helpful,
          I want to mention something that I learn during the reading, and
          that's about Sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sets as I read are really useful! One of the things that caught my
          attention was that sets don't accept repeated values, I found that
          awesome because it helps you a lot to clean the duplicate values.
        </p>

        <p>
          This helps to clean arrays too! and I found that really handy in some
          cases if we want to delete the duplicate values and save them into an
          array is really easy to achieve it!
        </p>
        <p>You can do it in this form:</p>

        <p>and then we need to do this:</p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>Something that is really making me think is to use Callbacks, I got a better idea in the Team activity but <strong>is another way to understand better how Callbacks work?</strong>
