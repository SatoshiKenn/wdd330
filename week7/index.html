        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Talking abuout this week reading I can say that the topic that most
          captured my attention was using cache. We were using a lot local
          storage but for one reason I thought that local storage it was in a
          way that cache, I can see is not and that makes me start thinking a
          lot about how can I apply using it while coding. I really liked the
          example they gave us in the book:

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I talked about cache,
          <strong>what is the difference between cache and local storage?</strong>
          I have plan to llok about this but I want to know from you that have a
          better understanding about these things to tell me a little more,
          thanks!
