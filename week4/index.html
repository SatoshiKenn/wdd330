        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Forms for real are really useful! I think this week was really good to
          remember a lot of different options in the forms and Object-Oriented
          Programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that caught my attention a lot it was to use a button
          disable, the last semester I learnded about forms and we give some
          rules with css to let the user know when one of the inputs have an
          invalid entry but to disable the button only if all th inputs in the
          form are ok it's super useful! To achieve this we need to use this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/disable.png" alt="disable button form" />
        <p>And we can change it with JavaScript:</p>
        <img
          src="images/disable2.png"
          alt="change button's state with JavaScript"
        />
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          For this week we didn't manage to do the tic tac toe working on a
          normal web browser, just in a phone web browser,
          <strong
            >We used 'ontouchend' instead of 'touchend' but what is the
            difference between them? is one older than other? we didn't figure
            it out how to use the touchend.</strong
