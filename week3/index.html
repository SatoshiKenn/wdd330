        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          This week was really interesting, reading about Objects, the DOM
          (Document Object Model), and Events help me to remember a lot of
          things maybe I was missing when I'm coding, I never had the
          opportunity to really read a book about programming and I need to say
          that is something that is helping me a lot to understand and learn new
          things, I realized that sometimes I always read in forums and some
          websites about programming but these reading activities are giving me
          another insight of how we can learn more about programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week I want to show an example about Objects and JSON that I
          found really interesting is that using the "parse()" method will take
          a string of data in JSON format and it will return a JavaScript
          Object.
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/jsontojs.png"
          alt="JSON to Javascript Object code example"
        />
        <p>
          And the "stringify()" method will do the opposite, taking a JavaScript
          object and returning a string of JSON data.
        </p>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Talking about questions, in the first week I read in the feedback that
          using the "getElemetnbyId" would be better than the "querySelector" in
          that case, this week we read about the DOM but <strong>I want to know if there
          is a way or a tip to understand which method will be better to use?</strong> I
          understand that "getElemetnbyId" only works with the "id" attribute
          but now is making me think a lot about how do I need to use both
          methods.
