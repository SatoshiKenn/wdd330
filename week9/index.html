        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          For this week reading was really good, I don't have to much comments
          about the Window object but I want to say that is really useful, I can
          remember times when I got the size of the window to achieve different
          things if it was in the range of my medium view, it was something I
          thought a lot about it and when I learned about the window object
          everything light up! It was a great experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the HTML5 APIs chapter I loved to read again about localStorage,
          for some reason is something that I need to keep practicing, I know we
          can build a lot of things really cool with this but sometimes I just
          go blocked thinking on these things. The APIs we have in HTML5 are
          really useful and I will continue studying them for my project and
          future skills! This week was fun!
        </p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          For this week I don't have questions but I'm really happy for your
          answers last week, I can feel that you are teaching me a lot of
          important things and now I really want to continue exploring and
          learning about new libraries because I was holding that desire to
          don't have negative practices or something like that, thank you for
          all of your feedback!
