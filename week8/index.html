        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          For the chapter 8 from "HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real world" I can say
          that we have a lot to practice and understand about animations in css,
          now I can see how powerful it is and how important is to keep
          practicing. I love how with transforms, transitions and animations we
          can do a lot of wonderful things to help our site looking more
          dynamic!

          Talking about the cahpter 12 I remember learning a little bit about
          different images formats, and SVG caught my attention a lot for the
          big functionality they have in web design! To be honest while I was
          reading the chapter and they recommend to use the inkscape to create
          svg images was incredible! I tried to look for this kind of program
          but I didn't have luck in find one! I'll try to use it and implement
          some images created with this program.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          Thanks for all of your feedback, I'll look more in detail about AJAX
          and JQuery, sometimes I want to keep investigating a lot of things but
          at the same time I don't really know if it will be something good or not,
          I remember that in a lot cases the assignments told us to don't use Wordpress
          or sites like that because it will be negative in our learning, but here's my
          question: <strong>Do you think it is ok to keep investigating in our own new 
          things? or we need to be careful to learn in a correct pace? Is there something
          you can recommend to wait a little longer to start investigating?</strong>
