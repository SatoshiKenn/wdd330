        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Something that really captured my attention was about to work always
          first in the mobile version and then move forward into the other size
          for the web application. It is really important that we create a web
          app that shows everything in a beautiful way withouth taking a lot of
          time loading the web app. Talking about the first exercise, it was
          really helpful, I liked how can you feel that you are having a
          conversation when reading the exercise.
          <br />
          The code in the first exercise was really good. I liked a lot the
          story editor with localstorage, I'm still having issues working and
          understanding localstorage but I hope I'll get better soon! Something
          that I realized is that in the code example they used
          "document.GetElementById" but I prefer to use "document.QuerySelector"
          I think is a better option to manipulate the DOM.
