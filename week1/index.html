        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Something that really captured my attention was about to work always
          first in the mobile version and then move forward into the other size
          for the web application. It is really important that we create a web
          app that shows everything in a beautiful way without taking a lot of
          time loading the web app. Talking about the first exercise, it was
          really helpful, I liked how can you feel that you are having a
          conversation when reading the exercise.
          <br />
          The code in the first exercise was really good. I liked a lot the
          story editor with localstorage, I'm still having issues working and
          understanding localstorage but I hope I'll get better soon! Something
          that I realized is that they used "document.GetElementById" but I
          prefer to use "document.querySelector" because I think is a better
          option to manipulate the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>For example, this is a extract of the code in the activity:</p>
        <img
          class="week1img"
          src="images/getE.png"
          alt="getElementById example"
        />
        <p>and I did mine like this:</p>
        <img
          class="week1img"
          src="images/queryS.png"
          alt="getElementById example"
        />

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          I had never thought about this before,
          <strong
            >what is the difference between a website and a web
            application?</strong
