        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Testing and Debugging is for sure a key concept and skill that all
          developers need to practice, if we want to have the best user
          experience wee need to do rigorously tests with our code in order to
          achieve this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the console is one of the best things I like to keep tracking of
          my code as we learn in the chapter 10 this week, this could help us to
          log the value of variables at different stages of the program to see
          how the code is working, I always use this way to be sure everything
          is returning the value I want.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <p>
          For this week I have question in the team activity, the last semester
          I learned that creating each element to append it in the DOM it would
          be better than only do all the html and use the "innerHTML" to put
          inside the things we need,
          <strong
            >is there a rule to know in which form do these things or is just
            the programmer's preference?</strong
          >
